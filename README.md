# WIPBot for Beat Saber streamers

## NOTE: requires BeatSaberPlus or CatCore

Make sure your channel moderation settings allow posting links in chat, otherwise only VIPs and above can post wip download links. Request codes obtained from the dedicated website can always be used but it might not be reliably online 24/7.

## This plugin adds the `!wip` command to your Twitch chat

Examples:  
`!wip` prints a help message in chat
`!wip e5a5bb` using a request code obtained from <https://catse.net/wip>
`!wip https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/9106712553161/9165053429928/Example_Wip.zip` using Discord
`!wip https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rcs9V_aq1kBjNhAQUdFz7f7kvWR/view?usp=sharing` using Google Drive
`!wip oops` removes users most recent request from queue

After someone has requested a wip, press the WIP button to download it:
